    <p>Hi [Name],</p>

    <p>
      After reviewing hundreds of businesses last quarter, we noticed many are losing measurable revenue because of a few common issues:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Outdated automation systems wasting staff hours</li>
      <li>Forgotten subscriptions quietly draining budgets</li>
      <li>Pricing strategies not aligned with current market conditions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The good news: these are straightforward to fix once you know where to look.
    </p>

    <p>
      Weâ€™ve created a quick <strong>60-second checklist</strong> that highlights these areas and shows you how to recover overlooked value.
